The housing market is a key indicator of economic health and social well-being, yet comprehensive and publicly accessible datasets in Brunei remain limited. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset of its kind in Brunei, motivated by the need to fill the gap in publicly available data on the local housing market.

Currently, the Brunei Darussalam Central Bank (BDCB) produces a Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) using data sourced from financial institutions, such as bank loan datasets. While the RPPI is published quarterly, the underlying raw data is not publicly available due to privacy restrictions. This limits research opportunities and transparency in understanding broader housing market trends. Furthermore, the RPPI only began in 2015, leaving a significant gap in historical housing data.

Our dataset addresses these challenges by providing a cost-effective and timely means to collect and analyze housing market data. Covering records from 1993 onward, it offers historical depth that complements and extends beyond the RPPI. It is valuable not only for tracking property price trends but also for advancing research in economics, urban planning, and real estate, supporting informed decision-making across sectors.

The data has been curated into a single Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file named `hspbn_2024-12-12.csv`. 
The dataset contains `{r} scales::comma(nrow(hsp))` property listing records which are enriched with area-level geotagged spatial information, spanning a period of `{r} max(years) - min(years) + 1` years from `{r} format(min(hsp$date), "%b %Y")` to `{r} format(max(hsp$date), "%b %Y")`.
The `{r} scales::comma(ncol(hsp))` columns of this dataset capture information for each property listing as detailed in @tbl-codebook below.

## Property Characteristics

The dataset includes a range of property characteristics suitable for exploring the relationship between property attributes and prices.
This section clarifies and provides context for the key variables in the dataset.

Bruneiâ€™s private residential property market offers a variety of options, including detached houses, townhouses, and apartments [@hassan2023sociocultural].
Based on this, property types have been categorised into four main groups --
Detached, Semi-Detached, Terrace, and Apartment -- to accurately reflect the diversity of property types in Brunei.
Additionally, there are a small number of records that reflect land sales, which are categorised accordingly as "Land".

Property tenure refers to the legal terms under which a person holds ownership or occupancy rights to a property. 
In Brunei, property tenure can be classified into three main categories: 
Freehold (in perpetuity), Leasehold, and Strata.
The latter of which refers to a form of ownership where individuals own a portion of a property, such as an apartment, and share ownership of common areas.

The dataset also includes information on the status of the property listing, indicating whether the advertisement refers to a proposed development, a newly completed development, or a property being resold. This categorical variable may be useful for analyzing price differences across different types of listings.

The numerical variables in the dataset are plot area, floor area, storeys, beds, and baths, each providing information on the physical attributes of the property. 
Note that plot area is measured in acres, while floor area is in square feet, as these are the common units of measurement used in Brunei. 
Users of this dataset may choose to convert these units as needed for their analysis.

Finally, metadata about the property is included for transparency and informational purposes. 
The variable agent specifies the (anonymised) identifier of the real estate agent or agency responsible for the listing, while source identifies the platform or medium from which the listing was obtained, such as a newspaper, magazine, or website. 
The method variable details the data collection approach, which is further elaborated in the section below.

## Spatial Information

In Brunei Darussalam, the administrative areas are organised hierarchically into three levels.
At the smallest level is the *kampong*, which refers to a village or neighbourhood.
Several kampongs grouped together form a *mukim*, which serves as a sub-district administrative area.
Finally, multiple mukims are nested within a *district*, the largest administrative unit, of which Brunei has four: Brunei-Muara, Belait, Tutong, and Temburong.
In our dataset, each property listing is associated with a specific kampong, mukim, and district, allowing for spatial analysis at different scales.

Importantly, the names of the kampongs, mukims, and districts have been harmonised with a standardised naming convention to ensure consistency across the dataset.
This also allows for ease of integration into Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software for spatial analysis and visualisation, namely the `{bruneimap}` R package [@jamil2024bruneimap].

## Listing Dates

The date variable in the dataset refers to the date on which the property listing was obtained. 
It is important to note that this is not the date the property was sold, nor does it necessarily reflect the precise timing of other transactions related to the property. 
Users should set their expectations accordingly, as the primary purpose of the date is to capture the state of the housing market at a specific point in time.

For analysis, we recommend aggregating data by quarters, as represented by the quarter variable. 
This aggregation helps address potential issues like missing data (see section below) and provides a more stable and robust representation of market trends, making it suitable for temporal analysis of the housing market.

{{< embed analysis.qmd#fig-price-evolution >}}

## Missing Values

The dataset contains missing values across various property characteristics including type, tenure, status, plot area, floor area, storeys, beds, and baths.
This is due to the nature of the property listings, which may not always include complete information when advertised.
It is noted, however, that there are no missing values for price and spatial information.
Missing values are represented by blank cells in the CSV file.
The severity of missing values is summarised in @tbl-avail.
In summary, 10.5% of the records contain missing values for all key house characteristics (i.e. plot area, floor area, beds, and baths), which, depending on the research question, may necessitate imputation or exclusion of these records.

<!-- > It is important that this section is as comprehensive as possible. There is no character limit, and you may use illustrative figures or tables; however, please do not offer background, interpretations, or conclusions. -->

In this section we describe the data collection process, which involved either a manual transcription of property listings from newspapers, or web scraping of online property agent listings.
In the later years, a large language model (LLM) was also employed to perform data cleaning on the web scraped data.
The data collection method varied over the years due to the availability of data sources and the evolution of technology.
@tbl-avail details which method was used for each year in the dataset, and whether the data was subjected to LLM post-processing.

All analyses were conducted using the R programming language [@rcoreteam2024language], with specific packages used described in each subsection below.

{{< embed analysis.qmd#tbl-avail >}}

## Manual Data Collection

Early years data collection was conducted manually, involving the transcription of property listing details from advertisements into a digital tabular format. 
This process was carried out by two of the authors over a period of nine months, from October 2023 to July 2024. 
The primary sources of the property listings were local newspapers and magazines. 
Physical copies were accessed through the National Archive of Brunei Darussalam, while digital versions, which are digitized replicas of the physical newspapers, were obtained online. 
These digital formats could not be scraped due to their lack of structured data, necessitating manual transcription.

Although daily newspapers from 1993 onward were available at the National Archive, the classified sections were not always present.
From 1993 to 1999, property advertisements were found only in Friday editions, and occasionally on Saturdays.
Thus, newspapers from both these days were reviewed weekly to capture the listings data.
This yielded roughly between 300 and 700 listings per year.

From the year 2000 onwards, property advertisements were published daily in the classifieds section.
However, reviewing every single daily edition was not practical and would increase the likelihood of recording duplicate listings, thus necessating a sampling strategy.
The sampling was done as follows.
Three newspaper editions per week were selected, and the classifieds section was reviewed for property listings. 
When a listing was found, it was recorded after careful filtering to ensure it was unique. 
This manual filtering process involved cross-checking based on the real estate agent, house characteristics, price, location, and date proximity. 
To avoid duplication, the same house listing was typically not recorded more than once within a quarter. 
This process yielded roughly the same number of listings per year as the earlier years.

## Web Scraping

To compile additional property data for the study beyond manual data collection, web scraping was employed using the R programming language, leveraging the `{rvest}` package [@wickham2024rvest]. 
This method enabled the systematic extraction of structured information from various local property listing websites such as panvilla.com (now defunct), bruhome.com, and bruneiproperty.com.bn.
Such websites provide extensive details on properties listed as "for sale" in Brunei, aggregating advertisements from real estate agents and property developers.

The process began by identifying the structure of the target websites, focusing on the HTML tags and classes containing the relevant information. 
The goal here is to programmatically pinpoint and collect specific information like text, links, or attributes.
For example, elements such as property prices, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other features were enclosed within specific HTML elements, which `{rvest}` functions like `html_elements()` and `html_text2()` could target and extract efficiently.
@fig-mockup-listing illustrates the structure of a typical property listing showing the various HTML elements to target.
Example code to perform this task in available in the repository.

Each webpage displayed a fixed number of listings (e.g., 128 per page). 
To scrape all pages, a loop was created to iterate through each page by modifying the URL (such as with an `&offset=<number>` parameter, where `<number>` represented the cumulative number of listings already scraped).

Extracted data required some cleaning to standardize formats for analysis. 
For instance:

- `price` varibales were cleaned by removing non-numeric characters and converted to integers.
- `beds` and `baths` were converted to integers.
- `date` variables were formatted properly as `Date` objects.
- Locations were stored as text strings. See the subsection below on spatial data harmonisation for more details.
- Any additional information was extracted from the property descriptions, which were often unstructured and contained valuable insights not captured in the primary fields.

<!-- The typical workflow for extracting data from a single property listing involved: -->

<!-- 1.	Read the HTML: The read_html() function from {rvest} was used to load webpage content. -->
<!-- 2.	Extract Key Elements: Functions like html_elements() and html_text2() targeted specific tags to extract data such as prices, beds, baths, and locations. -->
<!-- 3.	Clean and Standardize: Extracted data were cleaned and converted to appropriate formats (e.g., numeric for prices, integers for bedrooms and bathrooms). -->
<!-- 4.	Iterate Through Pages: A looping mechanism was employed to access subsequent pages by dynamically appending the offset parameter to the URL. -->
<!-- 5.	Extract Additional Information: For individual property pages, a custom function was created to navigate links and extract further details using a mapping function (map()). -->

Combining the workflow with a looping mechanism allowed for the systematic extraction of data from multiple pages and websites, and thus the automated scraping process enabled efficient data collection over time. 
This process however was highly contingent on the consistency of the structure of the websites being scraped from.
Over time, some websites shut down, while others changed their structure, requiring adjustments to the scraping scripts.
The web scraping process began in January 2022 and was conducted intermittently.
Data from 2012 up until the present (December 2024) were managed to be collected using this method, averaging around 1,500 listings per year.

## LLM Data Cleaning

A test on 329 randomly selected data points found that 306 were "correct" (93.0% accuracy), i.e. usable in the sense that either the details were extracted correctly or correctly identified "non listings".

- While effort has been made to ensure duplicate listings are removed, there is a slight possibility that some have slipped through the cracks.
- Data coverage. Only popular advertisements listed... So not a lot in Temburong or Tutong.
- Missing data.
