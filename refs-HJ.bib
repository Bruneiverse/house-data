  abstract = {Poverty exists not only in low and middle-income countries but also in high-income countries. Brunei, a rich country heavily reliant on hydrocarbon in Southeast Asia, is not an exception. Though poverty is not a topic that is politically taboo in Brunei, there are no statistics on poverty in Brunei. Yet, having such statistics would aid the government to achieve the target of zero poverty in 2035. Therefore, this technical paper provides a pioneering estimation of poverty rates in Brunei, utilising published data from `Household Expenditure Surveys' and focusing on the basic need approach. It calculates monthly household poverty rates based on the World Bank's poverty lines and OECD median income approach. It produces poverty rates based on expenditure and income. The research employs two models: a proportional model and a refined model. The results show declining rates of poverty, regardless of the poverty lines and models.},

  abstract = {The Government of Brunei Darussalam has played a central role in the provision of public housing in the form of landed property for many centuries. The period of modernity and economic growth has resulted in urban sprawl and declining available land. In a bid to arrest this unsustainable trend, the Government is promoting high-density, high-rise settlement complexes as an alternative to meet housing demands. The necessary legislation to support ownership of apartment units in multi-storey complexes, namely the Strata Title Act, has also been developed. The public, including real estate developers, however has not warmed to the initiative. Some analysts are of the view that there is a need to "re-engineer the Brunei society" to embrace vertical living via various means such as education and awareness. Nevertheless this paper will argue that the understanding and appreciation for Bruneians' lifestyle as well as social and cultural proxemics are actually important for urban planners to consider. This study shows the different cultural typologies in Brunei which enabled the researchers to understand the cultural and social determinants that influences respondents' choices with regards to the types and space preferences in relation to vertical housing. The paper puts forward a hypothesis that the Brunei society will warm up to vertical living if their cultural space needs are met in high-rise, high-density complexes. For the purpose of this study, a survey was conducted to validate the predictions of the model i.e. cultural architecture typology particularly targeting affected populations generated. The paper takes an insider-outsider approach which further emphasises the importance of local knowledge and understanding of local cultures and practices in research. It is hoped that the study will contribute to a better understanding of the housing demands of the Brunei society in general, and key cultural considerations with regards to vertical living in particular.},

However, there are varying values and meanings attached to a house depending on spatial and cultural differences, which influence people's urgency to become homeowners. Governance, consumption patterns and sociocultural institutions shape how consumers value housing and influence their desire to become homeowners. This chapter suggests that Brunei Darussalam's housing development and culture are unique compared to societies that have undergone significant financial liberalisation such as Britain and the United States. Financial liberalisation or financialisation involve governments reducing their restrictions on financial institutions and the financial markets. Based on qualitative research that involved 210 structured interviews, six in-depth interviews and secondary data, this study identifies the variables that influence the culture of homeownership in Brunei.},

While recognizing the socio-economic benefits and revenue streams that homestays gain from not only providing accommodation facilities, the wide range of cultural activities and exposures will strengthen the preservation of Brunei's cultural heritage. A case study approach and qualitative research method were conducted in this study. The key findings reveal that the community participation in three homestays is perceived to empower individuals in contributing on-going socio-economic development of their respective village. This study contributes knowledge and practical suggestions to potential ventures, homestay operators and researchers.}

  abstract = {In fast-developing regions like Southeast Asia monitoring urban areas presents a challenge given the lack of publicly available data. This is an issue that precludes the nuances of a city's growth and undermines the way land use is considered with respect to planning. The issue of data availability is very much present in the small nation of Brunei. Little is still known about the spatiotemporal evolution of its urban realm in particular, with regard to its national development planning. The country presents an interesting case-study given the pursuit of two highly opposing master-plans within the last 40 years. Its first master plan advocated polycentric growth away from the capital city, Bandar Seri Begawan. Its latest plan, however, currently promotes compact growth within a predefined urban footprint as a development control mechanism. This paper looks at remotely-sensed satellite data to examine the way in which the two implemented master-plan strategies have translated into actual land-use thus far. It employs a supervised classification procedure and characterises urban land into three typologies: urban infill, edge growth, and leapfrog growth. The paper's findings suggest that residential developments play a stronger role in driving urban growth in Brunei. This is particularly true for public housing, which has typically persisted in isolated pockets of low density at the city fringe. This study has produced a novel dataset of urban land use and land cover in Brunei; and, its quantification may prove useful in understanding the impacts of master planning and the formulation of development policies both within Brunei, and the wider Southeast Asian region.},

Three bottom-up methods were used, ordinary least square (OLS), support vector machines (SVM), and engineering modelling (EM). EM highlighted the energy inefficiency in these buildings, where the EM simulations showed the potential of halving the average measured consumption of 20.5MWh/year. SVM could demarcate buildings and households with consumption of {$>$}16.0MWh/year which are considered to be inefficiency. OLS is simple to use and the non-linear least square, showing R2{$>$}0.8, performs better than linear least square fit. This work allows two EUI benchmark measures to be determined and they have average values of 2035kWh/person/year and 56kWh/m2/year.},
