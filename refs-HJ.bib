Unlike most language models, where pre-training is based primarily on organic data sources such as web content or code, phi-4 strategically incorporates synthetic data throughout the training process. While previous models in the Phi family largely distill the capabilities of a teacher model (specifically GPT-4), phi-4 substantially surpasses its teacher model on STEM-focused QA capabilities, giving evidence that our data-generation and post-training techniques go beyond distillation. Despite minimal changes to the phi-3 architecture, phi-4 achieves strong performance relative to its size -- especially on reasoning-focused benchmarks -- due to improved data, training curriculum, and innovations in the post-training scheme.},

Brunei, a rich country heavily reliant on hydrocarbon in Southeast Asia, is not an exception. Though poverty is not a topic that is politically taboo in Brunei, there are no statistics on poverty in Brunei. Yet, having such statistics would aid the government to achieve the target of zero poverty in 2035. Therefore, this technical paper provides a pioneering estimation of poverty rates in Brunei, utilising published data from `Household Expenditure Surveys' and focusing on the basic need approach. It calculates monthly household poverty rates based on the World Bank's poverty lines and OECD median income approach. It produces poverty rates based on expenditure and income. The research employs two models: a proportional model and a refined model. The results show declining rates of poverty, regardless of the poverty lines and models.},

To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL.

The paper defines big data and illustrates how an inductive, big data approach can help improve decision-making.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The paper demonstrates how big data can support inductive reasoning that can lead to enhanced real estate decisions. To help readers understand the dynamics and drivers of the big data regime shift, an extensive list of hyperlinks is included.                                         Findings               The paper concludes that it is possible to blend traditional and non-traditional data into a unified data environment to support enhanced decision-making. Through the application of design thinking, the paper illustrates how socially responsible development can be targeted to under-served urban areas and helps serve residents and the communities in which they live.                                         Research limitations/implications               The paper demonstrates how big data can be harnessed to support decision-making using a hypothetical project. The paper does not present advanced analytics but focuses aggregating disparate longitudinal data that could support such analysis in future research.                                         Practical implications               The paper focuses on the US market, but the methodology can be extended to other markets where big data is increasingly available.                                         Social implications               The paper illustrates how big data analytics can be used to help serve the needs of marginalized residents and tenants, as well as blighted areas.                                         Originality/value               This paper documents the big data movement and demonstrates how non-traditional data can support decision-making.},

  abstract = {The Government of Brunei Darussalam has played a central role in the provision of public housing in the form of landed property for many centuries. The period of modernity and economic growth has resulted in urban sprawl and declining available land. In a bid to arrest this unsustainable trend, the Government is promoting high-density, high-rise settlement complexes as an alternative to meet housing demands. The necessary legislation to support ownership of apartment units in multi-storey complexes, namely the Strata Title Act, has also been developed. The public, including real estate developers, however has not warmed to the initiative. Some analysts are of the view that there is a need to "re-engineer the Brunei society" to embrace vertical living via various means such as education and awareness. Nevertheless this paper will argue that the understanding and appreciation for Bruneians' lifestyle as well as social and cultural proxemics are actually important for urban planners to consider. This study shows the different cultural typologies in Brunei which enabled the researchers to understand the cultural and social determinants that influences respondents' choices with regards to the types and space preferences in relation to vertical housing. The paper puts forward a hypothesis that the Brunei society will warm up to vertical living if their cultural space needs are met in high-rise, high-density complexes. For the purpose of this study, a survey was conducted to validate the predictions of the model i.e. cultural architecture typology particularly targeting affected populations generated. The paper takes an insider-outsider approach which further emphasises the importance of local knowledge and understanding of local cultures and practices in research. It is hoped that the study will contribute to a better understanding of the housing demands of the Brunei society in general, and key cultural considerations with regards to vertical living in particular.},

  abstract = {In fast-developing regions like Southeast Asia monitoring urban areas presents a challenge given the lack of publicly available data. This is an issue that precludes the nuances of a city's growth and undermines the way land use is considered with respect to planning. The issue of data availability is very much present in the small nation of Brunei. Little is still known about the spatiotemporal evolution of its urban realm in particular, with regard to its national development planning. The country presents an interesting case-study given the pursuit of two highly opposing master-plans within the last 40 years. Its first master plan advocated polycentric growth away from the capital city, Bandar Seri Begawan. Its latest plan, however, currently promotes compact growth within a predefined urban footprint as a development control mechanism. This paper looks at remotely-sensed satellite data to examine the way in which the two implemented master-plan strategies have translated into actual land-use thus far. It employs a supervised classification procedure and characterises urban land into three typologies: urban infill, edge growth, and leapfrog growth. The paper's findings suggest that residential developments play a stronger role in driving urban growth in Brunei. This is particularly true for public housing, which has typically persisted in isolated pockets of low density at the city fringe. This study has produced a novel dataset of urban land use and land cover in Brunei; and, its quantification may prove useful in understanding the impacts of master planning and the formulation of development policies both within Brunei, and the wider Southeast Asian region.},

Compared to previous iterations, Qwen 2.5 has been significantly improved during both the pre-training and post-training stages. In terms of pre-training, we have scaled the high-quality pre-training datasets from the previous 7 trillion tokens to 18 trillion tokens. This provides a strong foundation for common sense, expert knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. In terms of post-training, we implement intricate supervised finetuning with over 1 million samples, as well as multistage reinforcement learning. Post-training techniques enhance human preference, and notably improve long text generation, structural data analysis, and instruction following. To handle diverse and varied use cases effectively, we present Qwen2.5 LLM series in rich sizes. Open-weight offerings include base and instruction-tuned models, with quantized versions available. In addition, for hosted solutions, the proprietary models currently include two mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants: Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus, both available from Alibaba Cloud Model Studio. Qwen2.5 has demonstrated top-tier performance on a wide range of benchmarks evaluating language understanding, reasoning, mathematics, coding, human preference alignment, etc. Specifically, the open-weight flagship Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct outperforms a number of open and proprietary models and demonstrates competitive performance to the state-of-the-art open-weight model, Llama-3-405B-Instruct, which is around 5 times larger. Qwen2.5-Turbo and Qwen2.5-Plus offer superior cost-effectiveness while performing competitively against GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o respectively.

The dataset is based on residential property advertisement listings from Indonesia's major property web portals from January 2016 to September 2018. For this prototype index, the study initially focuses on Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. Our regression outputs generally show promising results and have the potential to become an official housing index. Future development will extend the index coverage to other large cities in the country and improve the characteristic variables in the model.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates the use of benchmarking methods for residential buildings in an energy rich economy. Three bottom-up methods were used, ordinary least square (OLS), support vector machines (SVM), and engineering modelling (EM). EM highlighted the energy inefficiency in these buildings, where the EM simulations showed the potential of halving the average measured consumption of 20.5MWh/year. SVM could demarcate buildings and households with consumption of {$>$}16.0MWh/year which are considered to be inefficiency. OLS is simple to use and the non-linear least square, showing R2{$>$}0.8, performs better than linear least square fit. This work allows two EUI benchmark measures to be determined and they have average values of 2035kWh/person/year and 56kWh/m2/year.},
