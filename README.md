  abstract = {This article introduces the first publicly available data
    set for analysing the Brunei housing market, covering more than
    30,000 property listings from 1993 to early 2025. The data set,
    curated from property advertisements in newspapers and online
    platforms, includes key attributes such as price, location, property
    type, and physical characteristics, enriched with area-level spatial
    information. Comprehensive and historical, it complements the Brunei
    Darussalam Central Bankâ€™s Residential Property Price Index (RPPI),
    addressing the limitations of restricted access to raw RPPI data and
    its relatively short timeline since its inception in 2015. Data
    collection involved manual transcription from archival sources and
    automated web scraping using programmatic methods, supported by
    innovative processing with Large Language Models (LLMs) to codify
    unstructured text. The data set enables spatial and temporal
    analysis, with potential applications in economics, urban planning,
    and real estate research. Although listing prices are only a proxy
    for market values and may deviate from actual sale prices due to
    negotiation dynamics and other factors, this data set still provides
    a valuable resource for quantitative analyses of housing market
    trends and for informing policy decisions.}
